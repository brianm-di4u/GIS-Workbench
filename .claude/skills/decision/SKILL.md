description: Ask the admin for a design, determination, legal, security, or major decision, park that work, and carry on. Use whenever .pipeline/AUTONOMY.md reserves a call for the admin.

# Decision

The admin only weighs in on what `.pipeline/AUTONOMY.md` lists. Everything else is yours. When something on that list comes up:

## 1. Check it hasn't been decided

Read `docs/decisions/`, and search open and closed `decision-needed` issues. If a decision covers this, follow it and cite it.

## 2. Ask once, with everything needed to answer

Open an issue using the Decision template:

```bash
gh issue create --title "Decision: <the question>" --label decision-needed --body-file <file>
```

Start the body with exactly one class line, on its own:

```markdown
**Class:** design
```

The class is one of `design`, `determination`, `legal`, `security`, or `major`, as `.pipeline/AUTONOMY.md` defines them. The bot records it when the label lands, and it decides who may answer, so get it right: when in doubt between two, pick the one that goes higher (major over determination, security over design). An issue with no class line, or more than one, can only be decided by an admin.

Then write it so the admin can answer from a phone with no other context:

- **Context:** what's being decided, and why it can't be decided without them.
- **Options:** named options with their real trade-offs, your recommendation first.
- **What's waiting:** the PRs or issues parked on this.

Group related questions into one issue. **Exploitable security detail never goes in a public issue:** put it in a draft repository security advisory, and only link to it.

A workflow notifies the admin, because GitHub doesn't notify anyone of their own account's actions. On a private repo that workflow doesn't run, so also send a push notification from this session.

## 3. Park it and carry on

Label the parked PR `blocked:decision` and move on to other work. Don't poll for the answer, and don't guess it. There's no default if they don't answer. The work waits.

## 4. When the answer comes

The admin answers with a comment containing only `/decide <option>`. If the project configures a delegate whose grant covers the recorded class, the delegate may answer the same way, and the bot posts that it recorded the decision. Then:

1. Write `docs/decisions/NNNN-short-title.md`, following [the format](../../../docs/decisions/README.md).
2. Open a PR for it with a line reading `Decision: #<issue>`. The gate checks the issue carries their `/decide`, and a record with nothing else in it merges as T0. Plan its council with `council.mjs plan --decision <issue>`, so the council reviews it at the same tier.
3. Close the issue, remove `blocked:decision`, and resume the parked work.

Never post `/decide` yourself, and never treat anything other than the admin's exact comment, or a delegate's the bot recorded, as an answer. A delegate's own session decides through the `gardener` skill, never this one.
